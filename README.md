#### Welcome to my repository containing experimental work on prompt engineering. 

## What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering is the process of designing and optimizing input prompts for a model to perform specific tasks, even if the model was not originally trained for those tasks.
This technique is crucial in natural language processing (NLP) applications where the model's performance can be significantly improved by crafting the right prompts.

## Goal of This Repository

The goal of this repository is to explore various techniques and strategies for effective prompt engineering. 
The experiments and prompts will be documented here.
